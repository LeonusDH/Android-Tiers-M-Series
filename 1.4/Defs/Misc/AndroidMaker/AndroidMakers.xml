        <description>An uninitialized Mark 1 Warrior. Mark one warrior units, freed from the constraint of appearing distinctly humanlike, are a class above Tier one Androids in survivability, strength, and power efficiency. These are units crafted for war and war alone, and they are very good at it given their low cost.\n\nIts small, box-like shape earned it the nicknames of "battle-box" and "blaster-bucket," while its default red paint color and military role earned it the affectionate name "Redcoat."</description>

# Description
Android Tiers M-Series is an extension sub-mod of Android Tiers Reforged to bring a new set of mechanical pawns into the colony for defense and survivability.

Android Tiers itself is a mod that intends to add mechanical colonists, animals, and related mechanics to RimWorld to create a completely new playstyle and bring a very different experience to the table.

## Features
* Introduction of the M-Series line of mechanical warrior units to RimWorld, using ATR's mechanical framework.
* The M1 Warrior Unit, a small box-like drone built for war and exceedingly difficult to take down.
* The M2 Bishop Unit, a slender, towering drone with 6 limbs that can interchangeably be arms or legs.
* The M3 Paladin Unit, a massive android with 4 leg-arms and 2 arms, that takes significantly less damage the more damage it has taken.
* The M4 Jellyman, an enigmatic mechanite blob with android intelligence of many powers and very odd properties, which can only be acquired by strange means.
* Alters some ATR behaviors with new mechanics and features.
* All M-Series units except the M4 can not wear apparel, and have high stats and an exceedingly resilient body layout. Killing an M-Series unit (ignoring RimWorld's "health threshold death" and random-raider death-on-downed chance) outright is nearly impossible, as they'll go down long before death.

## Objectives Remaining
* Implementation of M5 - M8, with interesting mechanics and differences, all focused around utility in combat and survivability.
* DLC specific abilities or content.
* Other stuff.
* Actual proper graphics.

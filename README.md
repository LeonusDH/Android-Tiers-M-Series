# Description
Android Tiers M-Series is an extension sub-mod of Android Tiers Reforged to bring a new set of mechanical pawns into the colony for defense and survivability.

Android Tiers itself is a mod that intends to add mechanical colonists, animals, and related mechanics to RimWorld to create a completely new playstyle and bring a very different experience to the table.

## Features
* Introduction of the M-Series line of mechanical warrior units to RimWorld, using ATR's mechanical framework.
* For now, just the M1 Warrior drone, a simple, cheap, but very robust drone for combat purposes, and the ability to manufacture it.
* All M-Series units have high base stats, but can not wear apparel due to their oddly shaped chassis and built-in features.

## Objectives Remaining
* Implementation of M2 - M8, with interesting mechanics and differences, all focused around utility in combat and survivability.
* DLC specific abilities or content.
* Other stuff.
* Actual proper graphics.
